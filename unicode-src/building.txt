1. Required Tools to Build
--------------------------

* Scons
* wxWidgets
* HTML Help Workshop
* Python is also required and is in the Python directory.

1.1. wxWidgets

It is probably best that the wxWidgets is not installed in the default
drive which is C: and use the D: drive instead. This is because wxWidgets
will need to be compiled to create the libs which can make the final
installation size upwards of 500MB.

To build NSIS Menu, install wxWidgets, create an environment variable
named WXWIN containing the path to the installation directory of
wxWidgets, run Contrib\NSIS Menu\wx\wxbuild.bat and build NSIS as usual.

To create both the ANSI and the Unicode lib files, just run:
>wxbuild.bat

To create the Unicode wxWidgets library, run:
>wxbuild.bat unicode

For the ANSI library, run:
>wxbuild.bat ansi

1.2. HTML Help Workshop

To compile the documentation as a CHM file, hhc.exe must be in the
PATH. It is available as part of HTML Help Workshop.

1.3. Scons

Scons is a replacement for make that is built on Python. Therefore,
before installing Scons, Python must first be installed. Make sure Scons
is in the PATH.

Typically scons.bat gets installed in the Script directory of the Python
installation. For example, c:\Python27\Scripts.

2. Build Scripts
----------------

There are four batch files that are in our repository for Unicode NSIS.

* mkdu.bat - Make debug Unicode
* mkru.bat - Make release Unicode.
* mkd.bat  - Make debug ANSI.
* mkr.bat  - Make release ANSI.

3. Creating a New Menu Header Image
-----------------------------------

The following script depends on the Python Imaging Library which is not
shipped with the Python distribution. If you do not have PIL installed,
download it from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ and install it.

When the version number increases, it becomes necessary to create a new
header image that reflect the new version number. This process has been
automated with a Python script for the Unicode version. The ANSI source
code will have the latest ANSI header image included in its distribution.

Go to Menu\images\Unicode. Run "create_header.py {version number}." For
example:

>python create_header.py "2.37"
